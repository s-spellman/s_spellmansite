## Current Project

---
Development of a "non-symmetic" version of the *quantum alcove model* to describe (DARK) Kirillov-Reshetikhin affine Demazure crystals. The model provides a bijection between alcove and tableau formulas for the type A non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at t=0. Future goals include finding bijections in other types and consequently tableau formulas for Macdonald polynomials in other types.
