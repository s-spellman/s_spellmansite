## Teaching Philosophy
---
Mathematics is a difficult subject that requires a strong foundation and logical, rigorous arguments. In this aspect it seems rigid and static. But it is at the same time an incredibly diverse and alive subject with more than one way to arrive at any given answer. In my classroom I strive to promote an environment where students can:

- Feel included and welcome in the field of mathematics.
- Develop logical reasoning and pattern recognition skills.
- Get a glimpse of what higher-level mathematics looks like.
- See multiple ways to tackle a problem.
