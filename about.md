Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I'm Sam, a mathematics PhD graduate from University at Albany under the advisement of [Cristian Lenart](https://www.albany.edu/faculty/lenart/ "Cristian Lenart"). I am currently on the market for a postdoctoral or visiting assistant professor position.

My research interests span the areas of algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. A common theme is in developing combinatorial models to facilitate computations, particularly related to the representation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups. My main approach is to encode complex algebraic or geometric objects as combinatorial objects, then use combinatorial methods to prove statements about the objects or do explicit computations. Computer software such as SageMath plays a role in this process: from helping test the models to executing the algorithms/computations.

Previously, I completed my Master's degree (M.S) in mathematics at the University of New Hampshire and obtained my Bachelor's degree (B.A) in mathematics at Colorado College.

My interests outside of mathematics include walking through forests, playing jazz bass, and cooking. Finding new ingredients to try and searching for the best food everywhere I travel helps bring unique flavors into my life.
